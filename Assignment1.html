			<p> why is it static? what do you like/not like about it? 

	<br>
				This is a static website very straight forward thought it may all seem so fluid and before known the difference between dynamic and static website i would have thought to think this was a dynamic website. I like this website alot because of its User Interface and also the Graphic and visual design that is implemented on this website. it is very fun and eye catching.

			<h2>Dynamic Website </h2>
			<div class="webaddress2">
			<a href="https://www.instagram.com"> Instagram </a>
			</div>

<p> Why is it dynamic ?

		I believe instagram to be a dynamic website as simple as it looks everyone is uploading at once or one at a time the application has a million of users which only make sense that the webpage uses a server technology to store and upload data.
